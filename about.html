        <h2>About Waziobia Fruit Shop</h2>

        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 2018, <strong>Waziobia Fruit Shop</strong> started as a
          small roadside fruit stand in Mainland, Lagos. Our founder, Mrs. Ngozi
          Okafor, had a simple vision: to make fresh, nutritious fruits
          accessible to everyone in the community. What began with just mangoes
          and watermelons has grown into a beloved local business offering over
          30 varieties of fruits and healthy products.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name "Waziobia" represents the three major Nigerian languages -
          <em>Hausa</em> (Wa), <em>Yoruba</em> (Zio), and <em>Igbo</em> (Bia) -
          symbolizing unity and inclusiveness. We serve customers from all
          backgrounds and celebrate the diversity of our beautiful Lagos
          community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the years, we have grown from a one-woman operation to a team of
          12 dedicated staff members who share our passion for quality and
          service. We have served over 50,000 satisfied customers and continue
          to expand our offerings based on customer feedback and seasonal
          availability.
